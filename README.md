# Design Patterns From Head First

# Behavioral Patterns

focus on the interaction and communication between objects. These patterns define how objects collaborate and delegate responsibilities among themselves to achieve a specific behavior.

- Observer Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Command Pattern

# Creational Patterns

focus on providing mechanisms for creating objects in a manner suitable for the situation at hand. They help in encapsulating the object creation process, hiding the complexities, and promoting flexibility and reuse.

- Abstract Factory Pattern
- Factory Method Pattern
- Singleton Pattern

# Structural Patterns

focus on simplifying the structure of a system by identifying simple ways to realize relationships between different entities. These patterns primarily deal with object composition or class composition, ensuring that if one part of a system changes, the entire system doesn't need to do so.

- Bridge Pattern
- Decorator Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Proxy Pattern
